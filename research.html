<h2>Research Interests </h2>
<p>From university to my PhD study, I have&nbsp;vast research
interests in Computer Science, Control Theory, Information Theory and
Embedded System etc. Right now I am quite interested in knowledge
learning, its representation and its embodiment in a cognitive robotics
system, inspired by computational neuroscience, developmental
neuroscience, developmental psychology or other natural systems.
Particularly, my research has been focused on</p>
<h4>Prediction Mechanisms in the cortical areas&nbsp; and
their
applications in robots &nbsp;</h4>
Currently I'm working with EU FP7-ITN PEOPLE <a href="http://www.robotdoc.org" target="_blank">RobotDoC</a>
project. I'm
working under the general topic "Neural Cognition Integration".
Specifically, my PhD thesis focuses on the prediction mechanism
emergence
hierarchically from the mirror neuron system to sensory cortex. Rather
than a centralized "predictive machine", prediction
mechanism is distributed into different cortex areas of the brain
hierarchically, each of which attempt to compensate the neural delay
that exists in its own brain area. So that prediction emerges in a
buttom-up and works in a
top-down manner. <br />
<br />
Therefore, the main objective of my doctoral study is to investigate
predictive mechanisms that exist in different hierarchy of the cortical
areas (especially visual and motor cortices) and their functions. Their
compensation for processing delays via prediction is necessary so that
cortical areas encode present, not past, events. To realize such
compensation in the context of neural networks from the mirror neuron
system, sensorimotor integration as well as visual cortex, we suggest
to use recurrent connections to create an internal memory to store the
previous dynamics. <br />
<br />
In the first experiment, we emphasized that a short-term memory should
exist within the mirror neuron system to assist with the action
understanding and prediction. A recurrent network with parametric
biases was thus applied to realize this system function in which the
parametric bias units recognize and encode walking patterns from
another robot. Such parametric bias units can be regarded as a
high-level conceptualized of the walking patterns, in which the
representations will further develop as pre-symbolic communication.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Furthermore, in the second experiment of the task, we focused on the
encoding of information in the primary visual cortex. Specifically, the
convergence of ventral and dorsal pathways with predictive functions
may give rise to the understanding of object affordance and object
manipulation and its control. To model this, we designed a recurrent
predictive network with a horizontal product where the information of
object feature and object movement becomes successfully separated in
its two hidden layers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since the dorsal pathway also allows for motor-relevant
representations, in the third experiment, we also developed such
recurrent connections for sensory latency compensation which also
support smoother and faster behaviours in sensorimotor integration
tasks. For example, the latency of the sensorimotor cycle of a robot
may affect the response time for the motor action. We expanded the use
of recurrent connections in the sensorimotor system, particularly in
the sensory prediction part, so that the recurrent connections can
compensate the delay in the sensory percepts. A continuous actor-critic
automaton (CACLA) was also applied in the generation of smooth
behaviours corresponding to the predictive sensory percepts.
Experiments showed that the predictive sensorimotor architecture
successfully increases the speed and robustness of the robot docking
experiment.<br />
<br />
In the last expriment, we combined the first and second experiments and
proposed that the learning of the visual pathways also leads to the
conceptualization of visual information. This was realized by recurrent
network with a horizontal product again, which was extended with
parametric bias units (see image). We exemplified this model through a
robot passively observing an object to learn its features and
movements. During the learning process of observing sensorimotor
primitives, i.e. observing a set of trajectories of arm movements and
its oriented object features, the pre-symbolic representation was
self-organized in the parametric units. These representational units
acted as bifurcation parameters, guiding the robot to recognize and
predict various learned sensorimotor primitives.<br />
<h4>Bio-inspired Particle Filter and its SLAM application </h4>
The utilization of multi-robot systems has a major advantage when
comparing to single robot systems, for example, with multiple robots
working together, it has the potential to accomplish a task faster than
a single robot. However, when a team of robots is sharing the same
worksite, the Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem
becomes much more difficult to resolve because a huge amount of
information is needed to be processed as well as analyzed. But on the
other hand, multi-robot SLAM can be more efficient if robots can
exchange and share information regarding their sensed data properly. In
the SLAM problem, especially for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), it is necessary to include
non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, for which the traditional
Kalman Filter (KF) cannot yield ideal solution. In applications
involving non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, Particle Filters
(PF), which are based on the concept of Monte Carlo simulation, are
more suitable estimation techniques. However, in problems involving
multiple dimensions, such as the multi-robot SLAM problem, when a huge
number of particles are being used, two problems, namely particle
impoverishment and sample size dependency, will occur during the
particle updating stage and these problems will become more severe. The
problems will reduce the accuracy of the estimation results and
resampling algorithms, such as Sequential Importance Sampling,
Stratified Resampling and Systematic Resampling are used to alleviate
these two problems. <br />
<br />
In this thesis, a novel PF algorithm for tackling the particle
impoverishment and sample size dependency problems is being studied and
its application in a multi-robot system is examined. In this algorithm,
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is incorporated into the generic particle
filter in order to drive the proposal distribution to approximate the
optimal solution. Mathematical proof and results obtained from a single
variable estimation problem as well as from the robot localization
problem show that, after the ACO optimization, better proposal
distribution and more accurate estimation results can be obtained. In
order to evaluate the performance of the ACO improved PF (PFACO) when
applied to non-linear and non-Gaussian problems, such as the
localization and SLAM problem, studies were conducted and utilization
of PFACO algorithm for multi-robot systems was introduced. In a
multi-robot environment, when two robots encounter, the same
information on the same estimation problem represented by the two sets
of particles will be re-evaluated based on information conveyed by
particles from different sets. The particles are then merged into a
single set and in such cases, parallel computing can be applied in
order to reduce the processing time. By software simulation, our
results are better than those from traditional approaches both in
estimation error and execution time.<br />
