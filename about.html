<p>My name is Junpei Zhong (traditional Chinese: 鍾俊培, simplified
Chinese:
钟俊培). I was born and grew up in the third largest city in China,
Guangzhou, locating in the southern part. In year 2002, I attended
South China
University of Technology, which is also in Guangzhou city. There I
studied
Control Science (major) and Computer Science (minor). Besides of taking
required classes, I also took part in other research projects (such as
RobotCup, embedded system design). I think my research interests
started since
that time. </p>
<p>In the year 2006, because I reached 10% of the overall ranking
of all the
exams, I had a chance to continue to post-graduate study without taking
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Admission_Test" target="_blank">the postgraduate admission examination</a>
(which should be
essential for most undergraduate students if they want to continue
studying in
graduate schools in China) . From the fall of 2006 to summer of 2007, I
was in
Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graudate School where I studied
more
advanced classes and conducted basic research experiments, but mostly
in
Mechatronics and Control parts. </p>
<p>However, in the year 2007, I got another offer from the Hong
Kong
Polytechnic University so I moved more south with much better
facilities and
supports. I did research in a biologically SLAM algorithm on multiple
robots.
The problem of solving a multi-robot SLAM is equal to solve a fairly
high-dimensional problem. However, I tried to solve it "softly" with
Ant Colony
Optimization (Please see my research section). It was my first time to
utilize
a biological-AI method to solve an engineering problem: the art of a
biology
phenomenon elegantly solves a difficult problem in an easy way. </p>
<p>After I realised the power of a biological system and its
inspiration to
solve difficult problems, I was would really interested in the power of
brain
that is assumed to be even more powerful. Therefore I joined University
of
Hamburg with RobotDoC Collegium, which is a multi-national doctoral
training
network on developmental robotics. More specifically, our part in the
WTM group
of Hamburg belongs to the "Brain Node", which focus on computational
neuroscience and its embodiment in a Cognitive Robotics system.</p>
